   - Emotion-focused healthy coping
   - Social support utilization
   - Meaning-making and reframing
2. MALADAPTIVE COPING PATTERNS:
   - Avoidance behaviors

   - Self-harm or destructive behaviors
   - Rumination and catastrophizing
3. RESILIENCE FACTORS:
   - Psychological flexibility
   - Self-efficacy and confidence
   - Social support networks
   - Optimism and hope
4. STRESS MANAGEMENT:
   - Stress recognition and awareness
   - Stress response patterns
   - Recovery and restoration
   - Stress prevention strategies
5. EMOTIONAL REGULATION:
   - Emotion awareness and labeling
   - Regulation strategies effectiveness
   - Emotional expression comfort
   - Distress tolerance capacity
